During the 21-month grounding of the 737 MAX after two fatal crashes, Boeing kept producing the jet in anticipation of a quick return to service. About how many did it turn out — and park in Renton, Everett and elsewhere — before suspending production in mid-January 2020?

200

400

737

1,100




Answer: 2  

The company built about 400 MAX jets before halting production in January. Boeing resumed production in May, although the FAA did not clear the plane to resume commercial service until November.

2. As the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a widespread lockdown of business in Washington state last spring, the state’s official unemployment rate (as subsequently adjusted) peaked above:

25%

16%

10%

8%

Washington’s unemployment rate topped 16% in April, climbing sharply due to the statewide lockdown. The rate dropped to 6% by October, before the latest COVID-19 surge.

3. While hundreds of thousands of Washington state workers lost their jobs and filed for unemployment benefits, scammers also flooded the system. The biggest organized ring that used information about real people to file false claims became known as:

Cozy Bear

Scarlet Scoundrel

Scattered Canary

Black Hat




Answer: 3

“Scattered Canary” is the name given to a Nigerian fraud ring blamed by security researchers for siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars through phony unemployment claims. The state says it has recovered much of the money.

T-Mobile finally completed its takeover of Sprint in April after scrutiny by antitrust regulators that extended through:

Two months

Two CEOs

Two years

Answer: 3

The deal was proposed about two years before it finally cleared all challenges and was consummated in April. An earlier effort to combine the two major cellular companies was floated in 2014 but abandoned over concerns the Obama administration would prevent it. T-Mobile CEO John Legere left the company right after the merger was completed, a month earlier than previously announced.

The FAA required some changes to the 737 MAX before it cleared the plane to resume commercial flights in late November. What further improvement did the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) insist Boeing make within two years?

Aerodynamic changes to the airframe 

A third measure of the plane’s angle of attack

A warning light when an angle of attack sensor fails

A way to silence the stick shaker stall warning




Answer: 2 

The European regulators are requiring that Boeing develop a third measure of the plane’s angle of attack, to back up the two built-in indicators. (Boeing earlier used only one indicator on each flight, leading to the fatal MAX crashes when that one indicator malfunctioned.) Safety measures 3 and 4 are required before the plane returns to service.
